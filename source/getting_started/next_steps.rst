What next?
==========

Now you should start getting familiar with Compute1! Don't hesitate to ask for help on Slack---that's what it's there for! In our
Slack workspace there is a channel (#washu-cluster) for conversations about Compute1. Join that channel and ask for help! Don't
feel like questions have to be well-formed before you post them---it's just out internal group chat and people will be happy to help
you! 

Check out the :ref:`useful links` page for links to tutorials, references, and up-to-date information on Compute1. Take a look
at the :ref:`b-commands` page for a quick reference of useful commands for interacting with LSF. See the :ref:`contacts page <contacts-page>` for
who to contact for help, or to report out-of-date information.


Optional: Join GitHub
---------------------

`GitHub <https://github.com/>`_ is a software development and version control platform. GitHub is used
extensively by the GEOS-Chem community (e.g., user support from the GEOS-Chem Support Team) along
with many other geoscience modeling communities. You are encouraged to create a GitHub account so
that you can

1. Save your code in a safe and accessible place
2. Ask for help from the GEOS-Chem Support Team
3. Participate in GEOS-Chem community discussions
4. Work on codes used internally in our group (scientific codes, but also things like this site)

Once you have a GitHub account, ask to be added to the `ACAG organization
<https://github.com/Atmospheric-Composition-Analysis-Group>`_.
