Join our Slack workspace
========================

Slack is useful for quick and easy back-and-forth conversations. We have a Slack workspace which
we use for a lot of internal communication. The first thing you should do is join this workspace.

Our workspace is private (group members only), so you will need an invite to join it. If you haven't
already received an invite, you should contact |slack-contact|.

You can use Slack in your web-browser or download the client (MacOS, Windows, Linux,
Android, iOS): `Download Slack`_.

You can contact |slack-contact| if you need help getting set up with Slack.
