Tips for NASA Pleiades
======================

This section provides general tips for setting up NASA NAS account and running GCHP on Pleiades.

Account setup
----------------

NASA provides detailed walk-through `NASA Account Setup`_:

* The difference among LDAP and launchpad passwords, PIN and passcode:

    * LDAP password is for logging on sfe and pfe/lfe node
    * Launchpad password is the password for logging on id.nasa.gov
    * PIN is the password set for RSA SecurID
    * Passcode is the instantaneous password generated by RSA SecurID

* Setting up public key and SSH passthrough would be helpful to make subsequent logging process easier:

    * Instructions: `NASA Subsequent Logins`_
    * Setting up SSH passthrough requires linux-based terminal. Window users may need to resort to terminal such as `Cygwin`_
    * Tips: keep the Cygwin installer for the sake of future package installation such as vim (Cygwin does not install vim by default)

Running GCHP on Pleiades
------------------------

* GCHP environment: source the environment script by :code:`source /u/dzhang8/gchp-intel.202202.env` to compile or run your GCHP

* Example running script can be found at :code:`/u/dzhang8/run.pbs`

* Model inputs :code:`/ExtData`

    * There is no :code:`/ExtData` like what we have on Compute1, but there are some customized downloaded inputs as follows:

        * Sebastian has downloaded multiple required inputs at :code:`/nobackupp2/seastham/ExtData/`
        * Dandan has downloaded required inputs for simulations in 2015 at :code:`/nobackup/dzhang8/ExtData/`

.. note::
    It would help to save space on Pleiades by first checking whether inputs you need are available or not and only download inputs you need
