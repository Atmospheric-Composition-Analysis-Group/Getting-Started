Welcome to the group!
=====================

.. note::
   If you are only doing data analysis with software like Matlab or Python, it is likely easier to install those locally on your laptop rather than going through the process of getting access to Compute1. WashU has instructions for installing Matlab, and if you're a Python person, Anaconda is easy to install on every operating systems. Feel free to ask for help if you have any questions!
